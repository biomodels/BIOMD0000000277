**Abstract:**   
A complex bio-mechanism, commonly referred to as calcium homeostasis,
regulates plasma ionized calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration in the human body
within a narrow range which is crucial for maintaining normal physiology and
metabolism. Taking a step towards creating a complete mathematical model of
calcium homeostasis, we focus on the short-term dynamics of calcium
homeostasis and consider the response of the parathyroid glands to acute
changes in plasma Ca(2+) concentration. We review available models, discuss
their limitations, then present a two-pool, linear, time-varying model to
describe the dynamics of this calcium homeostasis subsystem, the Ca-PTH axis.
We propose that plasma PTH concentration and plasma Ca(2+) concentration bear
an asymmetric reverse sigmoid relation. The parameters of our model are
successfully estimated based on clinical data corresponding to three healthy
subjects that have undergone induced hypocalcemic clamp tests. In the first
validation of this kind, with parameters estimated separately for each subject
we test the model's ability to predict the same subject's induced
hypercalcemic clamp test responses. Our results demonstrate that a two-pool,
linear, time-varying model with an asymmetric reverse sigmoid relation
characterizes the short-term dynamics of the Ca-PTH axis.

The model corresponds to hypercalcemic clamp test explained in the paper and
parameter values used in the model are that of "subject 1". In order to obtain
the plots corresponding to "subject 2" and "subject 3" the following
parameters to be changed: lambda_1, lambda_2, m1, m2, R, beta, x1_n, x2_n,
x2_min, x2_max, t0, Ca0, Ca1 and alpha.
